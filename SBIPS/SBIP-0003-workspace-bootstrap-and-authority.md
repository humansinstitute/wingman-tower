# SBIP-0003: Workspace Bootstrap And Authority

- Status: Draft
- Type: Standards Track
- Created: 2026-03-29
- Requires: SBIP-0001, SBIP-0002

## Abstract

This document defines workspace creation, recovery, listing, and management
authority for Superbased V4.

## Motivation

The workspace is the root sharing domain for the current protocol. The
bootstrap rules determine who can manage shared groups, records, and storage.

## Specification

### Workspace Creation

A workspace creation request MUST provide:

- `workspace_owner_npub`
- `name`
- `wrapped_workspace_nsec`
- `wrapped_by_npub`
- `default_group_npub`
- `private_group_npub`
- `default_group_member_keys`
- `private_group_member_keys`

The authenticated actor MUST equal `wrapped_by_npub`.

The server MUST create, in one logical operation:

1. the workspace row
2. a default shared group
3. a private group
4. epoch `1` for both groups
5. the initial wrapped member keys for both groups

The current implementation stores the default shared group in
`workspace.default_group_id`.

### Initial Group Requirements

Both initial member-key arrays:

- MUST be present
- MUST be non-empty
- MUST contain unique `member_npub` values
- MUST include the authenticated creator

The default group SHOULD use a `workspace_shared` kind.
The private group SHOULD use a `private` kind.

### Authority Model

The current protocol distinguishes:

- `workspace_owner_npub`: the stable workspace owner identity
- `creator_npub`: the actor that created the workspace on the server

A server implementing the current Tower semantics MUST consider a principal
authorized to manage the workspace if:

- the principal equals `workspace_owner_npub`, or
- the principal equals `creator_npub`

This is the current `canManageWorkspace` rule.

### Workspace Listing

An authenticated actor MAY list workspaces for their own `member_npub`.

The requested `member_npub` MUST match the authenticated `npub`.

A workspace is visible if the actor is a current member of any group owned by
that workspace owner.

### Wrapped Workspace Secret Visibility

In the current Tower implementation, `wrapped_workspace_nsec` and
`wrapped_by_npub` are returned only when the listing actor equals
`creator_npub`.

Servers SHOULD treat the wrapped workspace secret as sensitive and MUST NOT
return it broadly without an explicit rule.

### Workspace Recovery

Workspace recovery allows a member to create the workspace row after the group
structure already exists.

A recovery request MUST provide:

- `workspace_owner_npub`
- `name`
- `wrapped_workspace_nsec`
- `wrapped_by_npub`

Recovery MUST fail if:

- a workspace row for that `workspace_owner_npub` already exists
- the authenticated actor is not a current member of at least one group owned by
  that workspace owner

When recovering, the server SHOULD attach the earliest `workspace_shared` group
as `default_group_id` when one exists.

### Workspace Update

An authorized manager MAY update:

- `name`
- `description`
- `avatar_url`

At least one of those fields MUST be present.

An empty name MUST be rejected.

## Security Considerations

- Implementations SHOULD be explicit about whether creator authority is intended
  to be permanent or transitional.
- Recovery is powerful and MUST require authenticated membership evidence.
- Wrapped workspace secrets MUST be treated as encrypted confidential material.

## Backward Compatibility Notes

This SBIP matches current Tower behavior, including the creator-manager model.
Future revisions may separate bootstrap authority from ongoing administration.
